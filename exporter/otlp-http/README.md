# opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-http

The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-http` gem provides an [OTLP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto) over HTTP exporter for OpenTelemetry for Ruby. Using `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-http`, an application can configure OpenTelemetry to export collected tracing data to [the OpenTelemetry Collector][opentelemetry-collector-home].

## What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry-home] is an open source observability framework, providing a general-purpose API, SDK, and related tools required for the instrumentation of cloud-native software, frameworks, and libraries.

OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You can analyze them using Prometheus, Jaeger, and other observability tools.

## How does this gem fit in?

The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-http` gem is a plugin that provides OTLP export. To export to the OpenTelemetry Collector, an application can include this gem along with `opentelemetry-sdk`, and configure the `SDK` to use the provided OTLP exporter as a span processor.

Generally, *libraries* that produce telemetry data should avoid depending directly on specific exporter, deferring that choice to the application developer.

### Supported protocol version

This gem supports the [v0.11.0 release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/releases/tag/v0.11.0) of OTLP.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```sh
gem install opentelemetry-sdk
gem install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-http
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-sdk` in your `Gemfile`.

Then, configure the SDK to use the OTLP exporter as a span processor, and use the OpenTelemetry interfaces to produces traces and other information. Following is a basic example.

```ruby
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/exporter/otlp/http'

# The OTLP exporter is the default, so no configuration is needed.
# However, it could be manually selected via an environment variable if required:
#
# ENV['OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER'] = 'otlp'
#
# You may also configure various settings via environment variables:
# ENV['OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_COMPRESSION'] = 'gzip'

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure

# To start a trace you need to get a Tracer from the TracerProvider
tracer = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.tracer('my_app_or_gem', '0.1.0')

# create a span
tracer.in_span('foo') do |span|
  # set an attribute
  span.set_attribute('platform', 'osx')
  # add an event
  span.add_event('event in bar')
  # create bar as child of foo
  tracer.in_span('bar') do |child_span|
    # inspect the span
    pp child_span
  end
end
```

For additional examples, see the [examples on github][examples-github].

## How can I configure the OTLP exporter?

The collector exporter can be configured explicitly in code, or via environment variables as shown above. The configuration parameters, environment variables, and defaults are shown below.

| Parameter                 | Environment variable                         | Default                             |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `endpoint:`               | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`                | `"http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"` |
| `certificate_file:`       | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE`             |                                     |
| `client_certificate_file` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE`      |                                     |
| `client_key_file`         | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CLIENT_KEY`              |                                     |
| `headers:`                | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`                 |                                     |
| `compression:`            | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_COMPRESSION`             | `"gzip"`                            |
| `timeout:`                | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT`                 | `10`                                |
| `ssl_verify_mode:`        | `OTEL_RUBY_EXPORTER_OTLP_SSL_VERIFY_PEER` or | `OpenSSL::SSL:VERIFY_PEER`          |
|                           | `OTEL_RUBY_EXPORTER_OTLP_SSL_VERIFY_NONE`    |                                     |

`ssl_verify_mode:` parameter values should be flags for server certificate verification: `OpenSSL::SSL:VERIFY_PEER` and `OpenSSL::SSL:VERIFY_NONE` are acceptable. These values can also be set using the appropriately named environment variables as shown where `VERIFY_PEER` will take precedence over `VERIFY_NONE`.  Please see [the Net::HTTP docs](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html#verify_mode) for more information about these flags.
