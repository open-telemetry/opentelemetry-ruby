## Installation

This repository includes multiple installable packages. The `opentelemetry-api`
package includes abstract classes and no-op implementations that comprise the OpenTelemetry API following
[the
specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).
The `opentelemetry-sdk` package is the reference implementation of the API.

Libraries that produce telemetry data should only depend on `opentelemetry-api`,
and defer the choice of the SDK to the application developer. Applications may
depend on `opentelemetry-sdk` or another package that implements the API.

**Please note** that this library is currently in _alpha_, and shouldn't be
used in production environments.

The API and SDK packages are available on RubyGems.org, and can be installed via `bundle`:

```sh
bundle install opentelemetry-api
bundle install opentelemetry-sdk
```

To install development versions of these packages, follow the "Developer Setup" section (below).

## Developer Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose for your operating system
1. Get the latest code for the project
1. Build the `opentelemetry/opentelemetry-ruby` image
    * `docker-compose build`
    * This makes the image available locally
1. API:
    1. Install dependencies
        * `docker-compose run api bundle install`
    1. Run the tests
        * `docker-compose run api bundle exec rake test`
1. SDK:
    1. Install dependencies
        * `docker-compose run sdk bundle install`
    1. Run the tests for the sdk
        * `docker-compose run sdk bundle exec rake test`

### Docker Services

We use Docker Compose to configure and build services used in development
and testing. See `docker-compose.yml` for specific configuration details.

The services provided are:

* `app` - main container environment scoped to the `/app` directory. Used primarily to build and tag the `opentelemetry/opentelemetry-ruby:latest` image.
* `api` - convenience environment scoped to the `api` gem in the `/app/api` directory.
* `sdk` - convenience environment scoped to the `sdk` gem in the `/app/sdk` directory.

## Quick Start

```ruby
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'

# Set preferred tracer implementation:
SDK = OpenTelemetry::SDK

factory = OpenTelemetry.tracer_factory = SDK::Trace::TracerFactory.new
factory.add_span_processor(
  SDK::Trace::Export::SimpleSpanProcessor.new(
    SDK::Trace::Export::ConsoleSpanExporter.new
  )
)

tracer = factory.tracer('my_app_or_gem', Gem.loaded_specs['my_app_or_gem']&.version.to_s)
tracer.in_span('foo') do |foo_span|
  tracer.in_span('bar') do |bar_span|
    tracer.in_span('baz') do |baz_span|
      pp baz_span
    end
  end
end
```

See the [API Documentation](https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-ruby/) for more
detail, and the
[opentelemetry examples](./examples/README.md)
for a complete example.

## Release Schedule

OpenTelemetry Ruby is under active development. Our goal is to release an
_alpha_ version of the library at the end of September 2019. This release isn't
guaranteed to conform to a specific version of the specification, and future
releases will not attempt to maintain backwards compatibility with the alpha
release.

| Component                   | Version | Target Date       |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Tracing API                 | Alpha   | September 30 2019 |
| Tracing SDK                 | Alpha   | September 30 2019 |
| Metrics API                 | Alpha   | Unknown           |
| Metrics SDK                 | Alpha   | Unknown           |
| Jaeger Trace Exporter       | Alpha   | Unknown           |
| Prometheus Metrics Exporter | Alpha   | Unknown           |
| OpenTracing Bridge          | Alpha   | Unknown           |
| OpenCensus Bridge           | Alpha   | Unknown           |

## Release Process

To perform a release of one of the OpenTelemetry Rubygems, follow these steps.
Only a maintainer may perform a release.

1. Make sure the library's `VERSION` constant matches the version to be
   released. This constant is defined in the library's `version.rb` file.
2. Add an entry to the library's `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Tag the commit to be released. The tag must be of the form:
   `{library-name}/v{version}`. For example, to release `opentelemetry-api`
   version `1.2.3`, create the tag `opentelemetry-api/v1.2.3`.
4. Push the tag directly to Github.

After the tag is pushed, CircleCI will run the release workflow. This workflow
includes one final run of the unit tests, followed by the release script itself.

The [CircleCI project](https://circleci.com/gh/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby)
includes two environment variables that control the release process.

* `OPENTELEMETRY_RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` contains the API key used to authenticate
  with Rubygems for release.
* `OPENTELEMETRY_RELEASES_ENABLED` controls whether releases are enabled. If set
  to `true`, releases are performed normally. If set to `false` or unset, the
  release pipeline will execute, but the final `gem push` is disabled.
