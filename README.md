## Release Schedule

OpenTelemetry Ruby is under active development. Our goal is to release an
_alpha_ version of the library at the end of September 2019. This release isn't
guaranteed to conform to a specific version of the specification, and future
releases will not attempt to maintain backwards compatibility with the alpha
release.
