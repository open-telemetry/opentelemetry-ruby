# OpenTelemetry DelayedJob Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Delayed Job Ruby gem is a community maintained instrumentation for the [Delayed Job][delayedjob-home] Ruby jobs system.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-delayed_job
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-delayed_job` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To install the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::DelayedJob'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## Examples

Example usage of delayed_job can be seen in the `./example/delayed_job.rb` file [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/master/instrumentation/delayed_job/example/delayed_job.rb)

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-delayed_job` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.
