# OpenTelemetry Elasticsearch Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Elasticsearch Ruby gem is a community maintained instrumentation for [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch-home]. 
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-elasticsearch
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-elasticsearch` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Elasticsearch'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## Examples

Example usage can be seen in the `./example/trace_demonstration.rb` file [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/main/instrumentation/elasticsearch/example/trace_demonstration.rb)
