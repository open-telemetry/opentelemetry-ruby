# OpenTelemetry Mongo Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Mongo Ruby gem is a community maintained instrumentation for [Mongo][mongo-home].

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-mongo
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-mongo` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To install the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Mongo'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## Examples

Example usage of mongo can be seen in the `./example/mongo.rb` file [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/main/instrumentation/mongo/example/mongo.rb)

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-mongo` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.
