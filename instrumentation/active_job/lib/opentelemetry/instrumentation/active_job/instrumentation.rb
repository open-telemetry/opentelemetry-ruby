        ## Supported configuration keys for the install config hash:
        #
        # span_naming: when `:job_class`, the span names will be set to
        #   '<job class name> <operation>'. When `:queue`, the span names
        #   will be set to '<destination / queue name> <operation>'
        #
        # force_flush: when `true`, all completed spans will be synchronously flushed
        #   at the end of a job's execution (default: `false`). You will likely wish to
        #   enable this option for job systems that fork worker processes such as Resque.
        #
        # propagation_style: controls how the job's execution is traced and related
        #   to the trace where the job was enqueued. Can be one of:
        #
        #   - :link (default) - the job will be executed in a separate trace. The
        #     initial span of the execution trace will be linked to the span that
        #     enqueued the job, via a Span Link.
        #   - :child - the job will be executed in the same logical trace, as a direct
        #     child of the span that enqueued the job.
        #   - :none - the job's execution will not be explicitly linked to the span that
        #     enqueued the job.
        #
        # Note that in all cases, we will store ActiveJob's Job ID as the `messaging.message_id`
        # attribute, so out-of-band correlation may still be possible depending on your backend system.
        #
        # Note that when using the `:inline` ActiveJob queue adapter, then execution
        # spans will always be children of the enqueueing spans. This is due to the way
        # ActiveJob immediately executes jobs during the process of "enqueueing" jobs when
        # using the `:inline` adapter.
