# OpenTelemetry PG Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry PG Ruby gem is a community maintained instrumentation for [PG][pg-home].

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-pg
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-pg` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::PG'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

### Configuration options

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::PG', {
    # The obfuscation of SQL in the db.statement attribute is disabled by default.
    # To enable, set enable_sql_obfuscation to true.
    enable_sql_obfuscation: false,

    # You may optionally set a value for 'peer.service', which
    # will be included on all spans from this instrumentation:
    peer_service: 'postgres:readonly',
  }
end
```

## Examples

An example of usage can be seen in [`example/pg.rb`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/main/instrumentation/pg/example/pg.rb).
