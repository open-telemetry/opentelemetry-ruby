# OpenTelemetry Dalli Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Dalli gem is a community maintained instrumentation for the [Dalli][dalli-home] Memcache client.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-dalli
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-dalli` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To install the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Dalli'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```
