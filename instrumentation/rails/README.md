# OpenTelemetry Rails Instrumentation

The Rails instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for the [Ruby on Rails][rails-home] web-application framework.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rails'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```


### Configuration options

The `http.route` attribute is disabled by default because we use [.recognize](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v6.1.3/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/journey/router.rb#L65)
```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rails', {
    enable_recognize_route: true
  }
end
```

## Examples

Example usage can be seen in the `./example/trace_demonstration.rb` file [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/main/instrumentation/rails/example/trace_request_demonstration.ru)

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.
