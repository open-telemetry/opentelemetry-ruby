# List of all releasable gems. Each gem should include:
#  *  name: The name of the gem. (Required.)
#  *  directory: Gem directory relative to the repo root. (Required.)
#  *  version_rb_path: Path to version.rb relative to the gem directory.
#     (Required only if it does not match the gem name. e.g. The gem
#     "opentelemetry-sdk" would default to lib/opentelemetry/sdk/version.rb)
#  *  version_constant: The fully-qualified version constant as an array.
#     (Required because the OpenTelemetry namespace does not match the gem
#     name "opentelemetry".)
#  *  changelog_path: Path to CHANGELOG.md relative to the gem directory.
#     (Required only if it is not in the expected location.)
