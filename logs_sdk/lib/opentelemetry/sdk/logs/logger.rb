        #   the severity as it is known at the source. Also known as log level.
        # @param severity_number [optional Integer] Numerical value of the
        #   severity. Smaller numerical values correspond to less severe events
        #   (such as debug events), larger numerical values correspond to more
        #   severe events (such as errors and critical events).

        #   defined in {https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-id W3C Trace Context}.

        #   assigned trace id.

        #   for logs that are part of a particular processing span. If span_id

        #   flag as defined in {https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-flags W3C Trace Context}
