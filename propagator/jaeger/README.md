# opentelemetry-propagator-jaeger

The `opentelemetry-propagator-jaeger` gem contains a propagator for the
[Jaeger native propagation format][jaeger-spec]  This can be used on its
own as well as with propagators for other formats to support a variety
of context propagation scenarios.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry-home] is an open source observability framework, providing a general-purpose API, SDK, and related tools required for the instrumentation of cloud-native software, frameworks, and libraries.

OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You can analyze them using Prometheus, Jaeger, and other observability tools.
