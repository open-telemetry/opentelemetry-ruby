      # `deployment.environment` does not affect the uniqueness constraints defined through
      #   the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id` resource attributes.
      #   This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
      #   considered to be identifying the same service:
      #   
      #   * `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment=production`
      #   * `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment=staging`
