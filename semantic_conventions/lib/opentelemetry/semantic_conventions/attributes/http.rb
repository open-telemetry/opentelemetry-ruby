      # HTTP request method
      #
      # HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
      #   By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
      #   and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).
      #   
      #   If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.
      #   
      #   If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
      #   the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
      #   OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
      #   (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).
      #   
      #   HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
      #   Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
      #   Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value
