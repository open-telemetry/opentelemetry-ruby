      # Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name) on GCP)
      #
      # On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
      #   so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.
      #   
      #   The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
      #   The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:
      #   
      #   * **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
      #     Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
      #     [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
      #     with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invokable with
      #     multiple different aliases.
      #   * **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
      #   * **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
      #     *not* the function app, having the form
      #     `/subscriptions/<SUBSCIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
      #     This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
      #     a TracerProvider
