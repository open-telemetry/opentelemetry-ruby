  # OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions attribute names as constants.
  # These are auto-generated from source YAML in {https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions the semantic-conventions repository}.
  #
  # The constants in this namespace are all of the attribute names at all stability levels present in the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions as of {SemanticConventions::VERSION}.
  #
  # @note The constants here ought to remain within major versions of this library.
  #   However, there are risks with auto-generated code.
  #   The maintainers try to prevent constants disappearing, but we cannot guarantee this.
  #   We strongly recommend that any constants you use in your code are exercised in your test suite to catch missing constants before release or production runtime.
