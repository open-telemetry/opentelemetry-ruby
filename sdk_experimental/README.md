# Experimental SDK

The experimental SDK houses bleeding-edge(-ish) functionality that may have unstable APIs. Some examples of what's in
here:

* `traceresponse` propagator (in [w3c `trace-context` editor's draft](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/))
* Consistent Probability Sampler (marked as `experimental` in [opentelemetry-specification)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/tracestate-probability-sampling.md))
