      # Encoding is expected to conform to the HTTP Header Field semantics. Values are often encoded as RPC/HTTP request
      # headers.

      # The carrier of propagated data on both the client (injector) and server (extractor) side is usually an http request.
      # Propagation is usually implemented via library-specific request interceptors, where the client-side injects values
      # and the server-side extracts them.
