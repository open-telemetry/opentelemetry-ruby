    # Span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to
    # form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the
    # end-to-end latency and, optionally, one or more sub-spans for its
    # sub-operations.
    #
    # Once Span {Tracer#start_span is created} - Span operations can be used to
    # add additional properties to it like attributes, links, events, name and
    # resulting status. Span cannot be used to retrieve these properties. This
    # prevents the mis-use of spans as an in-process information propagation
    # mechanism.
    #
    # {Span} must be ended by calling {#finish}.
